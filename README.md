Battleship game

Authors Joshua Naymie, Jordan Weitz, Yelitza Moreno, Mohamed Al Hammoud

This game allows two players to play the battleship game while being able to chat live together.
There is a server that keeps a log of the real-time connections and game traffic between players.

The project is divided into four parts, Client Domain, Server Domain, Server GUI, and Client GUI. Each section has its own classes broken down by responsibility.



To run the server, java -jar Server.jar

To run the game, java -jar Client.jar
